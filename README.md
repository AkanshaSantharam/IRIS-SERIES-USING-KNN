# IRIS SERIES USING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS
 Used a MNIST dataset that contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. Preprocessed the data before feeding directly to the model.
Built a handwritten digit recognition model using Convolutional Neural Network, which is very effective for image classification purposes. Trained the model which takes training data, validation data, epochs and batch size as parameters and the model is evaluated to check how good it works using the testing data. 
Achieved an accuracy of 99%.
